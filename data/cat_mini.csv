<p>The Empire A 9315 ElfEm Eco is a 90cm width, traditional &amp; beautiful ivory colour variation of our popular wall-mounted cooker hood. The large 90cm width makes this the perfect choice for placement above your range cooker, or large family cooktop.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This hood has a glossy ivory finish, with metallic &amp; bronze detailing. It's these details that make you fall in love with this product. With the striking Kaiser brand plate on the chimney, the easy-to-use 5-button control panel, and our favourite feature - the handle. This handle is perfect for quickly hooking a utensil, oven mitts, or even a towel as you're busy cooking in your kitchen.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">As with all Kaiser cooker hoods, there's a choice of two operating modes to suit your kitchen layout &amp; installation. Either use the recommended air extractor mode, for maximum performance capability. Or set up in odour absorber mode (also known as recirculation mode), if your kitchen does not allow for external extraction.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This cooker hood has a standard 3-speed control - low, medium and high. And, has 2x LED lamps to sufficiently light your cooktop.</p>
<h3>Full Description</h3>
<p><strong>Exhaust air extractor mode</strong><br><br>The metal grease filter purifies cooking vapours and smells by absorbing the fatty constituents and other tiny particles in the kitchen fumes. The air exhaust pipes can be either connected to the exhaust air conduction or directed to the outside.<br><br><strong>Odour absorber mode</strong><br><br>It is not always possible to connect the fume extractor hood to the ventilation system. In this case, the extractor hoods by Kaiser can operate as a filtering system. The metal grease filter absorbs the fatty constituents and other tiny particles from the cooking vapours first, then the odorous substances and micro particles are directed through the activated charcoal filter. The cooking vapours and fumes return, purified, into the kitchen.<br><br><strong>Aluminium corrugated pipe</strong><br><br>Used in exhaust mode; a 150mm diameter aluminium pipe which is easy to use and to assemble. This pipe can be bent as needed and stretched along the required length. As a lightweight product this does not require additional fixing to secure. There is also an included adaptor to connect pipes with a 120mm conduit.<br><br><strong>Metal grease filter</strong><br><br>This long-life filter is made of stainless materials (stainless steel and aluminium). Grease filters should be cleaned every two months during normal operation of the hood in a dishwasher or manually, using mild detergent or liquid soap.<br><br><strong>Charcoal filter</strong><br><br>Our charcoal filters use chemically treated activated carbon, and have a high absorption capacity. The filer is capable of retaining particles of contaminating substances, the weight of which exceeds five times its own weight. The carbon filter removes various smells, smoke and steam impurities during cooking. The charcoal filters installed in our cooker hoods are for odour absorption/recirculation mode.</p>

This allows you to cook with a variety of pots &amp; pans at the same time for perfect results when cooking meals for your family &amp; friends. A wok adapter is also included with your purchase. This is best utilised on the triple Turbo burner, but you can use it on any burner of your choice.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">All Kaiser gas appliances are equipped with our automatic pilotless ignition. Simply turn the elegant gold knobs to ignite any of the reliable burners. And, of course, our control knobs are front-mounted so you don't need to reach over any naked flames. Your safety is always of paramount importance. This is why we also have our flame failure safety device, which will cut off the gas supply automatically in the event the flame is unexpectedly extinguished.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Our favourite elements are the sturdy cast iron supports - these are removable and can be easily cleaned either by a wipe or by placing them inside your dishwasher. That's right, we make your life easier by having dishwasher-safe components for easy cleaning. We're sure you'll love this too!<br></p>

<p>The Kaiser Empire EH 6355 ElfEm is a standard-sized, built-in, single-electric oven. This is a stunningly beautiful oven. With an enamelled ivory finish that gives a vintage look and style to make it a perfect option for your traditional style of kitchen.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Designed to make your life &amp; cooking easy, with 8 easy-to-use operating features. These include a double infrared grill, top and bottom heat, and fan-assisted cooking. However, one thing that sets this oven apart, is the fantastic electric rotating rotisserie. This is included with your purchase and allows you to cook a piece of meat evenly, as it turns in the cavity whilst cooking. This is also the perfect way to cook a whole chicken, for juicy meat and crispy skin!<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This oven is especially easy to clean and maintain too with enamel panels that can be wiped clean and a self-clean function. This allows you to spend more time on the things that matter, rather than hours cleaning the inside of an oven.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The bronze metal control knobs are highly durable (definitely not cheap plastic!), as is the front handle. And the analogue timer keeps the traditional look consistent, whilst still having an audible electronic timer for you to set cooking times with ease. This is a fantastic, high-quality oven for those who want great quality food, from a modern appliance, without any sacrifice on maintaining the style &amp; look of your beautiful kitchen.</p>

This allows you to cook with a variety of pots &amp; pans at the same time for perfect results when cooking meals for your family &amp; friends. A wok adapter is also included with your purchase.

Simply turn the elegant gold knobs to ignite any of the reliable burners. And, of course, our control knobs are front-mounted so you don't need to reach over any naked flames. Your safety is always of paramount importance. This is why we also have our flame failure safety device, which will cut off the gas supply automatically in the event the flame is unexpectedly extinguished.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Our favourite elements are the sturdy cast iron supports - these are removable and can be easily cleaned either by a wipe or by placing them inside your dishwasher. That's right, we make your life easier by having dishwasher-safe components for easy cleaning. We're sure you'll love this too!</p>
